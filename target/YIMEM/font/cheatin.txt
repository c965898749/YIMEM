My fonts are all free.  You can use them for personal or commercial projects,
and I ask for no money.  I would, however, love to hear from you.  If you use
my fonts for something please e-mail me letting me know how you used it.  Send
me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work. You are under
no obligation to do this, I just like to see how my fonts get used.

A license.txt file should have been included with this font, explaining the
license under which it is made available. You can also read it at:

About the font:

To achieve the intended effect of this font you have to alternate
capital and lower case letters.  It works best with words
containing an odd number of letters.

ExAmPlE

To get to the regular looking letters for the beginnings of words
there is a little trick.  You have to look up the letter you want
in the table below and enter the sequence listed.  For instance,
to begin a word with the letter 'A', hold down the alt key, type
0193 on the numeric keypad (not the row of numbers above the
letters), and then release the alt key.  Letters that have a
straight vertical line on their left side (B, E, M, etc.) will
appear just the same using either the sequence below or the
capitalized letter.  For all other letters you have to use the
alt+number sequence.

A  alt+0193
B  alt+0194
C  alt+0195
D  alt+0196

F  alt+0198
G  alt+0199
H  alt+0200
I  alt+0201
J  alt+0202
K  alt+0203
L  alt+0204
M  alt+0205
N  alt+0206
O  alt+0207
P  alt+0208
Q  alt+0209
R  alt+0210
S  alt+0211

U  alt+0213
V  alt+0214
W  alt+0215
X  alt+0216
Y  alt+0217
Z  alt+0218

A black space character has been provided as the '\'.  You can use
this between two words when the first one has an even number of
letters.

MaRk\SmItH

A half sized black space is available as the '|'.  Put this on the
end of a word with an even number of letters to give it a more
finished look.
